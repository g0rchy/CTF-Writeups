## Description

>I tried typing out the flag for you, but our Astronaut **Cole**son seems to have changed the terminal's keyboard layout? He went out to get a big **mak** so I guess we're screwed. Whatever, here's the flag, if you can somehow get it back to normal.

The description hints "cole" and "mak", a google search shows there's a keyboard layout called **colemak**
